CS F303 Computer Networks : 2020-21 Semester II

Assignment1 Statement:
We often access the web through a proxy. Squid is a caching and forwarding HTTP web proxy. In this
assignment, you have to write a program using sockets in the C language, without using any high level
libraries, to download the main page and logo from through a squid proxy,
which has been set up by the instructors. The proxy configuration is as follows:
Server: 182.75.45.22
Port: 13128
Login: csf303
Password: csf303
If you receive a HTTP 30x response you have to handle that and follow the redirection. You have to
figure out the HTTP protocol for proxy access on your own. It will help to set your browser to the
above proxy, access http://bits-pilani.ac.in/ from the browser and look at Wireshark traces from your
browser while the request is being made and responded to. Also refer to the HTTP 1.1 RFC. For
simplicity, just write a single program http_proxy_download.c, which should run as follows:
$ gcc http_proxy_download.c -o http_proxy_download.out
$ ./http_proxy_downoad.out bits-pilani.ac.in 182.75.45.22 13128 csf303 csf303 index.html logo.gif
where, as would be obvious, the command line arguments are respectively the URL, proxy IP, proxy
port, login, password, filename to save html as, filename to save logo as.
Do not hardcode any parameter in your program! Your program should work even if the proxy IP
changes, or the login/password changes, or BITS changes its logo image, or the base URL is changed.
You will submit just the single http_proxy_download.c file. The program must compile and run on
Ubuntu 18.04 or Ubuntu 20.04. 

## Test cases:

1. Correctly downloading the image from http://info.in2p3.fr/. This is the only image we will test
for. For other websites image download will not be tested. You can hardcode the location and
name of the image file in the base html for this test case. However, in the unlikely event that
they change the image or the filename it should still work.
2. Correct download of a second website (image will not be checked)
3. Correction download of a third website (image will not be checked)4. Correct handling of http redirects
5. Bonus: handling https for a static https website only (no image download required)
We have allowed the following domains to be accessed through the proxy to enable you to test your
code:

1. .google.com
2. .india.gov.in
3. .bits-pilani.ac.in
4. .in2p3.fr
5. .go.com
6. .jandarshan.cg.nic.in

We will use automated evaluations on Ubuntu systems and marking will be binary (either it
works or doesnâ€™t), so it is very important to ensure that you adhere to the guidelines. If you do
not adhere to the guidelines and our parser fails to extract your names you will not be marked
for this assignment. We will also use heuristics in our parser to check that you have used the correctlibraries, have not used higher level libraries, and have no hardcoded parameters. There will be no
manual rechecking for part marking if your program fails the tests. We will release a test script
which you can use to test that the names and IDs are being correctly parsed.
